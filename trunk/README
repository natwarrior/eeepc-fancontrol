I am not responsible for any damage you do to your hardware or software by using eeepc-fancontrol
I use it for my eee 701G and it works fine.
Always monitor your temperature with gkrellm or manual at /proc/eee/temperature

Attention:
Always remember the fan motor stops spinning under 14%. 
Version 0.2 checks for this and restores the fan if necessary.
