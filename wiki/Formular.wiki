#summary The formular used to calculate fan speed
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

The formular used by eeepc-fancontrol is very simple. Used variables are
$minSpeed (> 0 and < 100 and < $maxSpeed) for the minimum speed the fan should run,
$maxSpeed (> 0 and < 100 and > $minSpeed) for the maximum speed,
$normalTemp (> 0 and < $highTemp) for the temperature the fan should start spinning at $minSpeed,
$highTemp (> 0 and > $normalTemp) for the temperature the fan should spin at $maxSpeed

Additional information:
The fan speed value is 0 to 100. Those are percentages (wow!). The fan itself is PWM controlled.

The daemon adjusts fan speed by translating the temperature + the variables linear to a fan speed. The speedPercentage per Celsius+$normalTemp is calculated this way:
{{{
$speedPercentage = $minSpeed+(($maxSpeed-$minSpeed)/($highTemp-$normalTemp)*($currentTemperature-$normalTemp))
}}}
This formular is quite simple but effective. This way fan really spins only if needed.

Applicable settings for the vars are (tested, usualy not harming)
{{{
$minSpeed = 0
$maxSpeed = 0
$normalTemp = 52
$highTemp = 60
}}}
